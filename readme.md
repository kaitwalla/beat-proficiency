# Proficiency demonstration

The purpose of this repository is to provide a sample codebase that will allow you to demonstrate proficiency in Angular and Javascript. In all cases, please let your pairing partner know what you are thinking as much as possible, and feel free to ask questions! This is not intended as a demonstration of how much you have memorized, but how well you can code, troubleshoot and reason. Looking things up is OK, just let your pairing partner know what you are looking up when you do so. 

Please note that it is not expected that you will get through the entire thing, and you may be asked to skip some parts of or entire sections. This is not a reflection of anything other than time constraints.

At the end of the session, please commit all changes and push your branch to the repo.
